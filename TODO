= Description =

A command which launches a separate window with the images from the current article.

= Requirements =

- feh for image display. It is minimal and has slideshow and URL loading features.
Update: No longer required as an alternative can be specified in the config. feh is the default.

= Implementation =

1. Research mediawiki API and find a way to get the image URLs.
2. Create new command and make sure it works with completion. <- Done
3. Write a function to fetch the image URLs
4. Write a function to launch feh with the URLs as arguments.
5. Implement error handling in case of zero URLs or feh not present.
6. Link command in with said functions.

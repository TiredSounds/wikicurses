feature_images

= Description =

A command which launches a separate window with the images from the current article.

= Requirements =

- feh for image display. It is minimal and has slideshow and URL loading features.
Update: No longer required as an alternative can be specified in the config. feh is the default.

= Implementation =

1. Research mediawiki API and find a way to get the image URLs. <- Done
2. Create new command and make sure it works with completion. <- Done
3. Write function(s) to fetch the image URLs. This is done by searching
   the page source code (regex) and matching with those found through the API.
   This is done to filter out icons and such.
4. Write a function to launch feh with the URLs as arguments.
5. Implement error handling in case of zero URLs or program not present.
6. Link command in with said functions.
